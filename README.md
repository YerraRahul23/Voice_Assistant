# Voice Assistant Project

## Description
The Voice Assistant project is a hands-free, voice-activated system built with Python, enabling users to interact with their device using natural language commands. This assistant is capable of performing a wide range of tasks including:

- **Web searches**
- **Setting reminders**
- **Managing daily schedules**
- **Sending emails**
- **Controlling smart devices**

The project is designed to provide a seamless user experience through natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user inputs and speech synthesis for generating voice responses.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands and processes user commands using NLP.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Provides audible responses to user queries.
- **Smart Device Control**: Can interact with smart devices for automation.
- **Web Interaction**: Fetches real-time data, including weather, news, and other information from the web.

## Key Technologies

### 1. **Python**
   - The core language used to build the logic and control flow of the assistant.

### 2. **SpeechRecognition**
   - A speech-to-text library used to convert spoken input into text for processing.

### 3. **Pyttsx3**
   - A text-to-speech engine that enables the assistant to speak back responses to the user.

### 4. **Pyaudio**
   - Handles capturing voice input through the microphone, allowing real-time interaction.

### 5. **Web APIs**
   - Used to interact with external services like weather forecasting, sending emails, and controlling smart devices.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Microphone (for voice input)
